"""Forking a tracked skill, and the runs the sync refuses before writing anything.

Forking is one recorded step: the skill leaves its pin's name map and gains an attribution
record at the pin's commit, in the shapes `upstream/README.md` gives. A refusal exits 2 and
leaves the lab tree exactly as it was, so a maintainer never has to undo half a sync.
