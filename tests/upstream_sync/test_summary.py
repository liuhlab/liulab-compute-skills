"""The summary of what is new upstream: forked originals, the pstack section and eval reruns.

A forked skill and everything taken from pstack change only by hand, so the sync says what
upstream did to their originals and leaves the porting to the maintainer. pstack's pin moves
forward in the same run, so one pull request covers both upstreams.
