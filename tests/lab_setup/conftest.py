"""The fake machine every `/lab-setup` test runs the setup script against.

A home in `tmp_path` that holds what a member's machine holds after the two install
commands: Claude Code's marketplace clone, with a few skills and the `edison-cli` launcher,
a user bin directory on PATH, and a Kimi Code home. `codex` is a stub that appends to its
config what the real command would, and writes down every call, so no test reaches the
network. `HOME` is the fake home too, so a script that forgot `--home` would still miss the
real one.
