"""The run as a whole: safe to repeat, removes nothing, and asks before it changes.

A member reruns `/lab-setup` to repair a half-set-up machine, so on a set-up one a run has to
be a no-op down to the byte. The skill confirms each change first, which takes a run that
only reports (`--dry-run`) and a run of the steps the member agreed to (`--only`).
