"""What the installed `edison-client` actually offers, checked against what this package calls.

Every other test here answers with a stub, which proves the CLI's own behaviour and nothing
about the package it drives. This one reads the real client — importing it opens no socket —
so that a lock that quietly moved `edison-client` somewhere else is a red test rather than a
failure the first time someone spends a credit.

It is the guard the repo did not have when a solve resolved 0.11.1: that build installs
cleanly, reports a plausible version, and cannot be imported at all.
