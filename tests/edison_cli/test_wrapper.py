"""`bin/edison-cli`: the file that makes the command a bare name, and the loop it must not make.

Claude Code puts `<plugin-root>/bin` on PATH, so this wrapper is what turns every command in
`skills/lab-edison/` into the short form its pages already write — and what makes a permission
rule outlive a release, since the explicit spelling carries the plugin's version in its path.

Two properties, and both are about the shipped file rather than about a function. It has to be
committed EXECUTABLE, because the plugin cache is a clone and a mode 644 wrapper is a command
nobody can run. And it must exec the MODULE and never the console script: the script inside the
pixi environment wears this same name, this file is earlier on PATH, and `pixi run … edison-cli`
would therefore re-enter this file until the machine gives up. Neither is visible in Python, so
neither is asserted anywhere else.

The wrapper is run here only against a stub `pixi` that writes down its arguments, directly and
through the link `/lab-setup` puts on PATH. A real run builds a pixi environment of hundreds of
megabytes, and `tests/preflight.sh` is where this repo asks what a real machine has.
