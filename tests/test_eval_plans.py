"""`tests/eval.sh` folds a plan file the transcript names back into the transcript.

A plan-mode session may print only a pointer to its plan file, so the assertions have to read
the plan as well. These tests run `eval.sh --only` against a stub `claude` that prints such a
pointer, with HOME set to a fake home holding the plan. No real session starts and nothing
spends a token: the stub is first on PATH, and each test checks it was the one called.
