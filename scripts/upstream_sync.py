"""The upstream sync's merge-and-report step.

The maintainer runs it from `/lab-upstream-sync` (`.claude/commands/`), on a clean branch of
this repo, about monthly (`docs/adr/0012-upstream-skills-merge-from-a-pin.md`). It reads the
pins and the attribution record from `upstream/` (formats: `upstream/README.md`), reads each
upstream only through a fresh clone given on the command line, and writes only the lab tree.
It never touches the network.

`merge` takes a clone of every upstream with a pin. For a `merge` pin it brings every tracked
skill from the pin to upstream's tip, one file at a time, with `git merge-file`: the lab copy
is ours, the file at the pin is the base, the tip's is theirs. A skill is found under
`skills_dir` by its frontmatter `name`, so a bucket move costs nothing. A conflict is left in
the file between `<<<<<<< lab` and `>>>>>>> upstream`, with the pinned text between
`||||||| pinned` and `=======`. A skill gone from the tip is deleted or renamed: its lab copy,
pin entry and gate exemption go, unless the lab forked it. A skill upstream's plugin manifest
lists at the tip and not at the pin arrives under its own name. A forked skill is never
merged; the report says what upstream did to its original. If the pinned commit is gone from
the clone, because upstream rewrote its history, every difference between the lab copy and
the tip is marked as a conflict instead. For a `review` pin nothing is merged: the report has
a line per mapped item, a change whose every commit subject reads as a token cut or a model
change marked low priority, and a line per new skill. Every pin then moves to its tip, and
a Markdown report goes to stdout.

The report also carries two checks that a clean merge hides, and the eval cases to rerun.

- Stale words: a code span or file name under `skills_dir` at the pin and gone at the tip,
  still used in lab text. Lab text is every Markdown file git sees in the lab tree except
  `CHANGELOG.md` and `docs/adr/`, which are history; in a tracked skill, only the lines
  upstream wrote neither at the pin nor at the tip. A new lab page is covered the day it lands.
- Dropped edits: a line the lab added against the old pin that no file of its skill has now.
- Eval cases: each case in `tests/eval.sh` named `<skill>-*`, for a tracked skill whose
  upstream files changed. A case costs tokens, so the report only lists it.

`recheck` reruns both checks on the tree as it stands, against the lab at `--since` (default
`HEAD`, the sync not yet committed), so a lab line lost while resolving a conflict is caught.

`fork` makes a tracked skill lab-owned: its pin entry becomes an attribution record taken at
the pin's commit. Run it on a tree the merge has not touched, and commit it on its own.

Exit status: 0, done and nothing left to resolve; 1, done, with conflicts left in the files
(`merge`), or with something listed (`recheck`); 2, refused, with nothing written.
