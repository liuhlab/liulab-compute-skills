# Writing rules

Three rules. Two are checked by `vale` inside `pixi run check`; the third is on you.

## 1. Be concise

Shorter beats longer — in documents, issues, commit messages, replies, and skills. If a
sentence survives deletion without loss, delete it. The caps below are ceilings, not
targets.

## 2. Agent-facing documents have word caps

| Files | Cap |
| --- | --- |
| `AGENTS.md`, `docs/agents/*`, `skills/*/references/*` | 1200 (`Lab.LengthDoc`) |
| `skills/*/SKILL.md` | 600 (`Lab.LengthSkill`) |
| `docs/adr/*` | 400 (`Lab.LengthAdr`) |
| `CONTEXT.md` | 200 words per glossary entry, checked by conformance |
| `docs/research/*` | none — a research note is long by nature |

A skill body and the pages behind it are capped apart, because they are different things. The
body is an interface — what must be true before the first tool call — so it gets 600, and a
body that outgrows that is detail belonging in `references/`. The reference pages are this
repo's densest agent-facing prose and keep the document cap; the lab template's
`skills/*/SKILL.md` glob does not reach them at all.

`CONTEXT.md` has no file cap. A glossary grows one term at a time and never shrinks, so a
file-level count measures how big the domain is, not how well the entries are written — a
cap set for twenty terms fires again at twenty-five. The per-entry cap is the unit that
matches how the file grows, and it is the only one.

**Measure with the gate, not with `wc`.** `wc -w` counts table pipes, link targets and
shell flags as words; vale does not, and vale is what enforces the cap. The gap scales with
markup — from about 10% on plain prose to 65% on a page that is mostly a table — so `wc`
will tell you a reference page is near a cap it is nowhere near. Run `pixi run vale` and
believe it.

The caps are dials with tight defaults. Raising one is a one-line diff in `styles/Lab/` —
do it deliberately, and say why in the commit message. Do not raise a cap because a
document ran long; that is the cap working.

## 3. Human-facing prose avoids jargon and stays readable

`README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` and every `docs/` page a person browses: no terms from the lab
jargon list (`Lab.Jargon` — architecture-speak and needlessly Latinate verbs), and reading
grade 11 or below (`Lab.Readability`). No length cap — a tutorial is as long as the task.

**When `Lab.Readability` fails, match a passing exemplar — do not attack the number.** The
grade is a ratio over structure, so shaving words inside sentences you already committed to
moves it by hundredths. Find text that passes — an older section, a sibling page — and
rewrite toward how that text is segmented.

**This rule also covers what you say, not only what you write.** Nothing checks a chat
reply, so it is on you: when a person asks, answer in plain language and explain the term
you would otherwise reach for.

## How `.vale.ini` is arranged

**Every rule is named in every section.** Vale's `*` matches `/`, so the sections overlap
and their settings accumulate, the later section winning. A rule left out of a section
inherits whatever an earlier one said rather than defaulting off, which once left the
decision records checked by nothing on a green gate. Broad section first, narrowest last.

**Every declared file class names its section.** Each key in `[tool.liulab.agent-docs]` is
paired to a section by conformance rule 3, which looks for the key inside a section header
and wants exactly one match. So a new cap is a new section plus a key that no other header
spells — check both directions before you commit, because a key matching two headers fails
the gate and a key matching none is a file class checked by nothing.

## Which is which

Agent-facing means written for a machine that has to act: capped, exempt from the jargon
and readability rules, kept out of the site navigation with both `search: exclude: true`
front matter and absence from `nav:`. Human-facing means written for a person reading the
published site: checked for jargon and reading grade, uncapped. A file is one or the other
— if you are adding a document and cannot tell, it is human-facing.

Neither is exempt from the no-secrets policy. Agent-facing pages under `docs/` are still
built and still reachable by URL; unlisted is not private.
